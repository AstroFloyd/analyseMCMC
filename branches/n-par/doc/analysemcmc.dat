 Basic options:
         1                thin     If >1, "thin" the output; read every thin-th line 
    500000               Nburn     If >=0: override length of the burn-in phase, for all chains! This is now the ITERATION number (it becomes the line number later on).  Nburn > Nchain sets Nburn = 0.1*Nchain
   0.50000           NburnFrac     If !=0: override length of the burn-in phase, as a fraction of the length of each chain. This overrides Nburn above
   2.00000          autoBurnin     If >0: Determine burnin automatically as the first iteration where log(L_chain) > max(log(L_allchains)) - autoBurnin. Overrides Nburn and NburnFrac above
