    23: sluys, 26/11/2008
     - several improvements in plotspins, use new input file in doc/ !!!
       - improved screen output at file read
       - improved control over screen output (new variable prchaininfo)
       - new options for prival
       - started global determination of panel arrangement
       - skymap works again
    
    20: sluys, 25/11/2008
     - probability-interval settings now in input file, use new plotspins.dat from doc/
    
    18: sluys, 15/10/2008
     - finalised implementation of conversion theta/phi_Jo -> i, psi
     - started functions to plot vector between 2 detectors or plane of 3 detectors
       in sky
    
    17: sluys, 17/09/2008
     - started implementation for conversion theta/phi_Jo -> i, psi 
       (inclination and polarisation angle)
    
    16: sluys, 06/08/2008
     - plotspins: Read data unformatted to allow for huge logL + small changes
     - mcmcstats: Produce ApJL table with 2D ranges and letter superscripts
     - comp_pdfs: Read logL as first variable, Mc=2, etc.
    
    14: sluys, 19/07/2008
     - plotspins: 
       - try new file format first; continue after read error of only 1 line
       - print more info on selection of data points due to Lmax criterion
       - determine whether true values within 2D ranges
       - print 2D probability area to 2D plot title
     - __statistics.dat files: more stats to first lines, show if true val. in range
     - mcmcstats: make it read the new stats files
    
    13: sluys, 18/07/2008
     - values of 2D probability ranges saved in __statistics.dat
     
    12: sluys, 14/07/2008
     - added program mcmcstats that handles *_statistics.dat files, created by 
       plotspins
     - added program comp_pdfs that plots 1-2D pdf comparisons, using the 
       information in *__pdf1d.dat and *__pdf2d.dat created by plotspins.
       comp_pdfs needs the input file comp_pdfs.dat in doc/  See also
       doc/Makefile
    
    11: sluys, 14/07/2008
     - renamed functions.f to plotspins_functions.f (change your Makefile)
     - added some stuff for Vivien's thesis plots, done some cleaning
     - renamed this file from 010_revisions to ChangeLog.txt
    
    10: sluys, 12/06/2008
     - implementing probability areas, step 1
     
     9: sluys, 04/06/2008
     - plotspins.dat changed:
       - parameter normpdf2d was added
    
     7: sluys, 30/05/2008
     - plotspins.dat changed:
       - the parameter autoburnin, if >0, sets the burnin to the first point where 
         log(L_chain) > max(log(L_allchains)) - autoburnin.
       - scloglpl,sclogchainspl allow to scale the logL, chains plots in the vertical
         direction as before, or using post-burnin data only
       - srcsz,scrrat, bmpxsz,bmpysz and pssz,psrat allow the 'physical' sizes of the 
         plots to be changed for screen, bitmap and ps/pdf respectively. Only in case
	 of bitmap (.png), one sets pixel size, otherwise arbitrary size and plot ratio
	 .pngs > 1000pix seem to give funny 2D-PDF plots!!!
       - whitebg allows a white background in screen/.png plots
       - scfac (not yet fully implemented), but should be used to make .png plots smoother
       - unsharp sets the strength of an unsharp mask applied to .png plots
     - I added some more options to plotspins:
       - I changed the screen output a little here and there
       - the parameters that give the maximum L are printed in the statistics table
       - chains and logL before burnin are plotted in a different shade
       - resolved some error messages that occured if plot ranges had zero width
       
     5: sluys, 14/05/2008
     - I added an input file (doc/plotspins.dat)
     - I put subroutines in a different file (functions.f)
     - Hence, the Makefile changed
     - Most important smaller changes:
       - the code recognises the new (12-par) output format
       - different plot symbols can be used for different chains (chainsymbol in 
         the input file)
       - the point with maximum log(L) can be plotted (pllmax in input)
       - a plot of L vs parameter value can be made (plparl in input)
       - 1D PDFs can be normalised in different ways (normpdf1d in input)
       - 2D binning was sped up ~2.5x, so plots are nicer now
       - a new movie lay out was added
